    2025/08/18 3.28.0 Qt6 support, without preview - UI: - Reorganized the Scale/Zoom menu in the Appearance tab (moved "Match Project CRS" here and renamed it to "Fit to vector layers extent") - Added warning for users with dual integrated/dedicated video cards (force QGIS to use the integrated video card via the control panel to avoid crashes) - OpenLayers: - Increased OpenLayers library version from 6.15.1 to 10.6.0 - Updated ol3-search-layer to https://github.com/andreaordonselli/ol-search-layer/ (new repository published for the occasion) - Legend icons for layers with rule-based symbology are now visible - Added support for expressions in labels (allows concatenation of multiple values to create complex labels) - Adjusted the "Fit to vector layers extent" function - Leaflet: - Increased Leaflet library version from 1.7.1 to 1.9.4 - Fit to vector layers extent" now also blocks zooming out beyond the pan limit - Other: - Improved photon-geocoder code and enhanced the OpenLayers search marker
    2025/07/07 3.27.0 Add symlinks on install of QtWebEngine to locate the Qt Frameworks for preview on macOS (thanks to @nameloCmaS) - Add support to read embedded SVG Marker Symbologies (thanks to @nameloCmaS) - Improved address search, you can choose between OSM and BAN (thanks to @yohann1c for commit) - Fix the styling of leaflet buttons
    2025/04/07 3.26.0 New option for groups in the graphical interface "Collapsed if LayersList" which collapses the group in the LayerSwitcher (qgis2web reflects the group as open/closed as configured in QGIS) - Adjusted export of SimpleFill icons for LayersList - The map automatically moves if the popup goes off-screen (autopan) - Fixed double quotation escape for "value" in style creation - Adjusted buffer width below the text - Improved WMS query: first URL provided, then URL encoded, then passed through URL proxy - Removed QgsApplication.initQgis() from leafletWriter for use with QGIS 3.42 - Fixed apostrophe escape for "classAttr" in style creation - The form was extended for the recommended QGIS version (it was not visible on some PCs) - Updated the recommended version to QGIS 3.40 - Removed QgsApplication.initQgis() and QgsApplication.exitQgis() from maindialog for use with QGIS 3.42
    2025/02/13 3.25.1 Preview also usable on MAC computers, Leaflet: Adjusted link export
    2025/02/05 3.25.0 leaflet: export does not return an error if the data contains apostrophes or double quotes, the logic for counting symbols in the leafletLayerScripts file has been modified, which seems to have resolved the issue causing QGIS to crash with the error "Windows fatal exception: access violation, slCount = symbol.symbolLayerCount()" - openlayers: style definition supported in points and pixels in addition to millimeters, attribution definitions have been improved, simple marker and SVG Marker symbols support X and Y anchoring set for the symbol (now zoom work well), the use of multiple Simple Marker and SVG Marker symbols within the same Marker is supported, improved creation of PNG icons for the LayersList: icons are clearly visible even in cases of multiple symbols and different anchor points, legend support for raster layers is now available
    2024/12/11 3.24.0 openlayers: Added cluster export for categorized and graded point geometries with variable color from green (few geometries) to red (many geometries), openlayers and leaflet: supported apostrophe and double quote everywhere: in layer group title, in layer title, in categorized/graded legend, in project title, in project abstract, Added saving of the Popups check state in the Layers and Group tab
    2024/10/28 3.23.0 remove polyfill, added text for recommended qgis version, fix disable doHover & doHighlight on ol-control, fix openlayers style export for categorized decimal double fields [solves #1081], fix openlayers to export null values ​​to table in case of categorized layer [solves #1096], Add Basemap choice for XYZ/WMS layers - it will be reflected in LayersList as radio button (not checkbox) (thanks to @pietrocomelli) [solves #1077] - Correct spelling length (thanks @dgetz) [solves #1104], update WIKI documentation

    2024/02/20 3.18.2 Online WIKI section merges with Help tab of qgis2web. Repository's Docs folder is created, which is displayed online as GitHub pages, and locally loaded into qgis2web's WIKI tab (instead of Help).
    2024/02/12 3.18.1 Restored layer title in openlayers/leaflet layerswitcher in absence of style - Fixed bug: now openlayers popup is visible on click even if "highlight on hover" setting is active, thanks to @cukavac - Greatly improved OpenLayers popup graphics, both for desktop and smartphone - Added "popuplayertitle" variable in layer, which allows printing layer title in openlayers popup - Added maximum height and width for images in openlayers/leaflet popup - Fixed bug: features data set as clusters are now shown in openlayers popup both on click and with active hover - Fixed the problem of different popups on the first click and on the second - Changed overlay-pane z-index. Measurement now appears above the basemaps and layers, as well as the popup, as well as geolocate user
    2024/01/22 3.18.0 Fixed the representation of dash lines, dot lines and dash-dot lines for lines, polylines and polygon strokes for both openlayers and leaflet export - Added Set All combo box which allows you to set the layer list options massively - Fix apostrophes or double quotes in layer names or in legend values - If layer's style is "No Symbols" the layer's name will not be visible in legend

    2023/12/09 3.17.1 Fix openlayers wms query: now visible in the popup, only visible layers on the map will be queried, not all; the tables returned by the WMS server will have a defined text size, a loading icon has been added which makes it clear that the click on the map has been made and that the popup is waiting for the remote WMS server to respond.
    2023/11/28 3.17.0 For openlayers export: added area measurement, fix popup if measurement not completed, modified the drawing style now visible on both light and dark backgrounds, added graphic tips for opening and closing measurement drawing, deactivating measurement deletes measurement drawings
