description=Export to an OpenLayers/Leaflet webmap
about=
 QGIS plugin to export your project to an OpenLayers or Leaflet webmap. It replicates as many aspects of the project as it can, including layers, extent and styles (including categorized and graduated). No server-side software required.
 
 Please consider a small donation at https://www.opengis.it/buy-me-a-coffee/
 Even a modest "virtual coffee" can help support our commitment to providing quality software.
 As a token of our gratitude, donors will receive as a gift qgis2o.gis (a plugin enhancing OpenLayers export of qgis2web).
 
 Happy mapping!

changelog= 
    2024/10/28 3.23.0 remove polyfill, added text for recommended qgis version, fix disable doHover & doHighlight on ol-control, fix openlayers style export for categorized decimal double fields [solves #1081], fix openlayers to export null values ​​to table in case of categorized layer [solves #1096], Add Basemap choice for XYZ/WMS layers - it will be reflected in LayersList as radio button (not checkbox) (thanks to @pietrocomelli) [solves #1077] - Correct spelling length (thanks @dgetz) [solves #1104], update WIKI documentation
    2024/07/30 3.22.0 Transition from QtWebKit to QtWebEngine, maindialog graphic improvement, button reduced/extended for Layers list Expanded, update ol-geocoder and ol-layerswitcher library, improve color and shadow export, fix minor bug
	2024/06/07 3.21.0 organized appearance tab and added Title export variable, cluster choice visible only if layer is point and with single symbol, project title in 4 corners, dynamic size for svg icons in layerswitcher, openlayers: added project "Abstract" description export, openlayers: restored geocoder icon in preview window, openlayers: greatly simplified and organized js and css export code - now ol-controls elemets acquire automatic position, adjusted custom color and background for all ol-controls elements, disabled "popup on hover" and "highlight on hover" if mouse pointer is over an ol-control element, same svg usable for categorized or graduated symbol with different symbologies properties, leaflet: adjusted width of layerswitcher elements in case of categorized or graduated symbology, leaflet: adjusted popup size in case of presence of media, update WIKI documentation
    2024/05/13 3.20.0 openlayers: popup is able to show videos supported by the browser, fixed popup's height and width, image and video contents (thanks to @JanKirchhoff), commented projection's extension in layers.js and qgis2web.js files, svg icon is clearly visible in legend even in case of large dimensions (svg icon is shown directly, not qgis png's legend) (thanks to @geraldo), support for colored svg icons (fill and border) - leaflet: .js and .css files referring to layerslist are stored in the export folder only if layerslist is visible, fixed svg icons border width - updated writeAsVectorFormat function that was deprecated (thanks to @agiudiceandrea), updated WIKI documentation
	2024/03/26 3.19.0 qgis2web supports layer groups - both OpenLayers and Leaflet exports achieve layer groups (non-nested) exportability - adapt the 'highlight on hover' and 'popup on hover' functionalities to work when layer groups are present - groups and layers' list is sorted as in QGIS and layer groups contains layers - "Popups" choice is positioned as the last item in the list options, becomes a drop-down menu, closes if check is not selected and disappears if there are no exportable popup fields - "Popup fields" ' attributes are displayed in italics and are aligned in the same column as the parent - "visibility" and "popups" choices for groups are removed (currently unnecessary) - Introduced a new layerswitcher for Leaflet export, thanks to @jjimenezshaw - Excluded WIKI and Preview functionality for Linux users who are unable to install and use QtWebKit (So the plugin will launch and be usable without these features) - openlayers export acquires by default declutter:false - xyz openlayers layers do not acquire type:base by default (with only one basemap, it's possible to disable it to have a white background) - fix export for text-field that contains more then 255 characters, thanks to @anonymous378 - Fix highlighting of multi-point and multi-line geometries for both OpenLayers and Leaflet - Fix Leaflet error for mouse out of cluster: "e.target._eventParents[i].resetStyle is not a function" - Modified WIKI graphics for better readability (navigation menù at the top)
    2024/03/20 3.18.3 Fixed blocking bug. It is now possible to read the new value format of the symbollayer color property since QGIS version 3.36
    2024/02/20 3.18.2 Online WIKI section merges with Help tab of qgis2web. Repository's Docs folder is created, which is displayed online as GitHub pages, and locally loaded into qgis2web's WIKI tab (instead of Help).
    2024/02/12 3.18.1 Restored layer title in openlayers/leaflet layerswitcher in absence of style - Fixed bug: now openlayers popup is visible on click even if "highlight on hover" setting is active, thanks to @cukavac - Greatly improved OpenLayers popup graphics, both for desktop and smartphone - Added "popuplayertitle" variable in layer, which allows printing layer title in openlayers popup - Added maximum height and width for images in openlayers/leaflet popup - Fixed bug: features data set as clusters are now shown in openlayers popup both on click and with active hover - Fixed the problem of different popups on the first click and on the second - Changed overlay-pane z-index. Measurement now appears above the basemaps and layers, as well as the popup, as well as geolocate user
    2024/01/22 3.18.0 Fixed the representation of dash lines, dot lines and dash-dot lines for lines, polylines and polygon strokes for both openlayers and leaflet export - Added Set All combo box which allows you to set the layer list options massively - Fix apostrophes or double quotes in layer names or in legend values - If layer's style is "No Symbols" the layer's name will not be visible in legend   
    2023/12/18 3.17.2 Disable Mapbox GL JS export, new openlayers geocoder: fix its marker and smartphone view, reorganized OpenLayers/Leaflet folders, fix openlayers layerswitcher height which did not allow the use of the pointer in the part occupied by the element.
    2023/12/09 3.17.1 Fix openlayers wms query: now visible in the popup, only visible layers on the map will be queried, not all; the tables returned by the WMS server will have a defined text size, a loading icon has been added which makes it clear that the click on the map has been made and that the popup is waiting for the remote WMS server to respond.
    2023/11/28 3.17.0 For openlayers export: added area measurement, fix popup if measurement not completed, modified the drawing style now visible on both light and dark backgrounds, added graphic tips for opening and closing measurement drawing, deactivating measurement deletes measurement drawings
